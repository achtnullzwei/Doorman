# Customization

Explore various examples to customize and extend the Doorman firmware. From adding custom sensors to tweaking automation settings, these examples help you tailor the device to your specific needs. Follow the guides to unlock full flexibility and make the most of your setup.

## Create a simple TC Command Binary Sensor
You can easily add custom binary sensors for any TC Command, in addition to the preconfigured ones. This allows you to listen for and respond to any other bus command, expanding the functionality of your system.

::: code-group
```yaml [Command Builder]
<!--@include: minimal.example.yaml-->

binary_sensor: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
  - platform: tc_bus # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    name: "Custom Command" # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    type: open_door # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    address: 0 # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    web_server: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
      sorting_group_id: sorting_group_listeners # [!code ++] [!code focus]
```
```yaml [32-Bit Commands]
<!--@include: minimal.example.yaml-->

binary_sensor: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
  - platform: tc_bus # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    name: "Custom Command" # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    command: 0x00001100 # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    web_server: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
      sorting_group_id: sorting_group_listeners # [!code ++] [!code focus]
```

## Control the internal RGB Status LED
To control the onboard RGB LED with a button (for example), just reference the light entity with the internal id: `doorman_rgb_status_led`.
```yaml
<!--@include: minimal.example.yaml-->

button: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
  - platform: template # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    name: "Turn on Status RGB LED to red" # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    on_press: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
      - light.turn_on: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
          id: doorman_rgb_status_led # [!code ++] [!code focus]
          red: 100% # [!code ++] [!code focus]
          green: 0% # [!code ++] [!code focus]
          blue: 0% # [!code ++] [!code focus]
```

## Use the External Hardware Button
If you want to use the external button to trigger automations, extend the `on_press` block and add your own actions.

```yaml
<!--@include: minimal.example.yaml-->

binary_sensor: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
  - id: !extend doorman_external_button # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    on_press: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
      - logger.log: "External button pressed!" # [!code ++] [!code focus]
```

## Use I²C Sensors
If you want to add sensors via the I²C bus, you can use the two available GPIO pins and add the I²C component to your configuration. You can then attach your sensors to these two I²C GPIO pins.

```yaml
<!--@include: minimal.example.yaml-->

i2c: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
  sda: GPIO40 # [!code ++] [!code focus]
  scl: GPIO48 # [!code ++] [!code focus]
  scan: true # [!code ++] [!code focus]
  id: i2c_bus # [!code ++] [!code focus]
```

## Create Your Own Doorbell Pattern
If you want to create a custom doorbell pattern, you can easily extend the existing doorbell entities. For more information about patterns, refer to the [ESPHome Docs](https://esphome.io/components/binary_sensor/index.html#on-multi-click).

```yaml
<!--@include: minimal.example.yaml-->

# Extend the doorbell_pattern event entity // [!code ++] [!code focus]
# Add a new special event type // [!code ++] [!code focus]
event: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
  - id: !extend apartment_doorbell_pattern # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    event_types: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
      - "special" # [!code ++] [!code focus]

# Extend the Ring-To-Open Pattern Conditions // [!code ++] [!code focus]
# You need to extend each Door Pattern Condition where you want to use the pattern // [!code ++] [!code focus]
select: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
  - id: !extend rto_apartment_door_pattern_condition # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    options: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
      - "special" # [!code ++] [!code focus]

# Extend the apartment_doorbell / entrance_doorbell entity // [!code ++] [!code focus]
# and add your new special pattern // [!code ++] [!code focus]
binary_sensor: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
  - id: !extend apartment_doorbell # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    on_multi_click: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
      # Special Pattern // [!code ++] [!code focus]
      - timing: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
          # Press twice quickly with at most half a second in between. // [!code ++] [!code focus]
          - ON for at most 0.3s # [!code ++] [!code focus]
          - OFF for at most 0.5s # [!code ++] [!code focus]
          - ON for at most 0.3s # [!code ++] [!code focus]
          - OFF for 1s to 1.5s # [!code ++] [!code focus]
          # Press once slowly with at most 1.5 seconds in between. // [!code ++] [!code focus]
          - ON for at most 0.3s # [!code ++] [!code focus]
          - OFF for 1s to 1.5s # [!code ++] [!code focus]
          # Press once // [!code ++] [!code focus]
          - ON for at most 0.3s # [!code ++] [!code focus]
          - OFF for at least 2s # [!code ++] [!code focus]
        then: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
          - logger.log: "Special pattern detected!" # [!code ++] [!code focus]
          - event.trigger: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
              id: apartment_doorbell_pattern # [!code ++] [!code focus]
              # Use the previously defined new event type here // [!code ++] [!code focus]
              event_type: special # [!code ++] [!code focus]
```

## Light On When Entrance Doorbell Rings
You can easily set up an automation to turn on the light whenever someone rings the entrance doorbell. This can be useful for enhancing visibility or simply making it easier to see who is at the door. Simply configure the automation to trigger the light based on the doorbell event.

::: code-group
```yaml [Basic]
<!--@include: minimal.example.yaml-->

binary_sensor: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
  - id: !extend entrance_doorbell # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    on_press: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
      - tc_bus.send: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
          type: "light" # [!code ++] [!code focus]
```
```yaml [Based on sun's elevation]
<!--@include: minimal.example.yaml-->

# Import the Home Assistant sun elevation sensor // [!code ++] [!code focus]
sensor: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
  - platform: homeassistant # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    id: sun_elevation # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    entity_id: sun.sun # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    attribute: elevation # [!code ++] [!code focus]

# Extend the entrance doorbell sensor // [!code ++] [!code focus]
binary_sensor: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
  - id: !extend entrance_doorbell # [!code ++] [!code focus]
    on_press: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
      # Sun elevation is <= 0 (dark) // [!code ++] [!code focus]
      - if: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
          condition: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
            sensor.in_range: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
              id: sun_elevation # [!code ++] [!code focus]
              below: 1 # [!code ++] [!code focus]
          then: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
            # Turn on the light // [!code ++] [!code focus]
            - tc_bus.send: # [!code ++] [!code focus]
                type: "light" # [!code ++] [!code focus]
```
