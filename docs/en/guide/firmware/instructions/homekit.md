After flashing the firmware with HomeKit integration and connecting Doorman to your Wi-Fi network, the status LED will **pulse red and blue** to indicate that HomeKit is not paired yet.

Follow the steps below to pair it with the Home app on your iPhone or iPad:

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-between; gap: 20px;align-items: center;" markdown>
   <div style="min-width:260px;flex: 1 1 260px;" markdown>

   1. To pair Doorman via HomeKit, open the Home app on your iPhone or iPad. Tap the "+" icon and select "Add Accessory".

   2. Scan the HomeKit setup QR code on the right side.  
      If you can't scan the code, select "I Don't Have a Code or Cannot Scan" and then choose "Enter Code Manually" to type in the setup code: `291-21-998`
   
   3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete pairing.  
    Once connected, you can control Doorman through the Home app or with Siri.
