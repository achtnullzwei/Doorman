# Indoor Station Settings

With Doorman, you can fine-tune your indoor station to suit your environment and preferences. Whether it's customizing ringtones for different types of calls or adjusting volume levels, Doorman provides a powerful yet simple way to personalize your intercom experience.

Settings are automatically made available once your device has been successfully identified. In cases where automatic identification fails, you can trigger the process manually using the `Identify Indoor Station` button.

## Available Settings

The actual settings available to you depend on your specific indoor station model and firmware version. Please refer to the [supported settings list](../../reference/esphome-component-device#model-setting-availability) for up-to-date compatibility.

::: info NOTE
Most intercom-related settings are hidden by default in the interface.

To view them, click `SHOW ALL` in the Doorman web interface or enable the corresponding entity in Home Assistant.
