# Indoor Station Settings

With Doorman, you can fine-tune your indoor station to suit your environment and preferences. Whether it's customizing ringtones for different types of calls or adjusting volume levels, Doorman provides a powerful yet simple way to personalize your intercom experience.

Settings are automatically made available once your device has been successfully identified. In cases where automatic identification fails, you can trigger the process manually using the `Identify Indoor Station` button.

## Available Settings

The actual settings available to you depend on your specific indoor station model and firmware version. Please refer to the [supported settings list](../../reference/esphome-component-device#model-setting-availability) for up-to-date compatibility.

The model must be set first; otherwise, the settings won’t appear in the web interface or in Home Assistant. Once the model is set, the settings will become visible—reload the web interface to see them.

::: tip
If the model is already configured but the entities are still missing or unavailable, try restarting Doorman or reloading the ESPHome integration in Home Assistant.

Most intercom-related settings are hidden or disabled by default. To view them, click `SHOW ALL` in the Doorman web interface or enable the corresponding entity in Home Assistant.
