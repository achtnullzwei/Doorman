# Ring To Open <Badge type="warning" text="RTO / Party Mode" />

The Doorman firmware features a Ring To Open automation, which was previously known as Party Mode.

### What does it do?
As the name implies, the entrance door will open automatically when someone rings the doorbell.
This feature is especially useful during a party, allowing guests to enter the building simply by ringing the bell.

### How do I use it?
You can activate or deactivate the Ring to Open function individually for each door.
There are separate switches available, such as `RTO: Entrance Door`, `RTO: Second Entrance Door`, and `RTO: Apartment Door`.

You can also configure an additional trigger, like the function button or the external button.

Additionally, there's a central switch called `Ring to Open`, which can control multiple doors at once.
You can configure which doors are affected via the setting `RTO: Central Toggle – Door Selection`.

::: tip INFO
Most settings are hidden by default in the interface.

To view them, click `SHOW ALL` in the Doorman web interface or enable the corresponding entity in Home Assistant.
