# What is Doorman?

Doorman allows you to connect your [TCS](https://www.tcsag.de/) or [Koch](https://www.kochag.ch/) intercom to any home automation system. Additionally, some rebranded [Niko](https://www.niko.eu/), [Scantron](https://scantron.dk/) and older [Jung](https://www.jung-group.com/) intercoms are counterparts to the TCS and Koch models.

### What about other intercoms?
    
Doorman isn't limited to TCS or Koch intercoms.

You can use it to simulate a button press to trigger a door opener or light with the integrated solid-state relay (up to 40V, max 2.5A).

If your intercom operates on a 2-wire bus within the 14-24V DC range, it might be possible to implement other protocols as well.
You can also monitor the voltage level on older intercoms (14-24V DC) using the internal ADC and trigger specific actions based on the readings.
