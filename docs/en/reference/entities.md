# Entities
The Doorman firmware exposes many entities by default. On the sub-pages is a list of the available sensors and controls, along with an explanation of how to configure them.

## Viewing Entities in Home Assistant

1. In the Home Assistant UI, navigate to [ESPHome](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integration/?domain=esphome).
2. Select your Doorman.
3. A dashboard will appear, listing all sensors and controls available for automations.
