# TC:BUS ESPHome Component

The TC:BUS Component for ESPHome allows you to interface with a [TCS:Bus](https://www.tcsag.de/) or [Koch TC:Bus](https://kochag.ch/) intercom system, providing automation, monitoring, and interaction capabilities within the [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) ecosystem.
This component can trigger automations based on specific telegrams received from the intercom system.

It also supports sending telegrams to the intercom and receiving various status updates (e.g., bus telegrams and door readiness).
Additionally, actions can be set up to respond to specific telegrams from the intercom system.

::: tip Note
This component requires hardware like the Doorman-S3 or a [DIY solution](https://github.com/peteh/doorman) in order to communicate on the bus.

| `telegram_lambda` | Lambda expression used to dynamically generate the telegram that will trigger the binary sensor, instead of using a fixed telegram. Cannot be used with `telegram`.  | No       |               |
| `type`           | Telegram type that will trigger the binary sensor, used alongside `address` and `serial_number`. Cannot be used with `telegram`.  | Yes       | `unknown`     |
| `address`        | 8-bit address that serves as a condition to trigger the binary sensor. If you set it to `255`, it will catch all addresses. | No       | `0`           |
| `address_lambda` | Lambda expression to evaluate whether the binary sensor should trigger based on the address.              | No       |               |
| `payload`        | 32-bit payload that serves as a condition to trigger the binary sensor.  | No       | `0`           |
| `payload_lambda` | Lambda expression to evaluate whether the binary sensor should trigger based on the payload.              | No       |               |
| `serial_number`  | Specific intercom serial number that serves as a condition to trigger the binary sensor. If you set it to `255`, it will catch all serial numbers. | No       | `unknown`     |

::: info
You can use **either** `telegram`/`telegram_lambda` **or** a combination of `type`, `address`/`address_lambda`, `payload`/`payload_lambda`, and `serial_number`, but **not both** simultaneously.\
This ensures the binary sensor triggers either through a specific telegram or a combination of parameters, preventing conflicts.

## Callbacks
### Received Telegram
The `on_telegram` callback of the `tc_bus` hub allows you to utilize the [TelegramData](#telegram-data) struct, accessible as the `x` variable.

```yaml
on_telegram:
  - lambda: |-
      ESP_LOGD("TAG", "Received Telegram Type: %s", telegram_type_to_string(x.type));

      if (x.type == TELEGRAM_TYPE_OPEN_DOOR) {
        ESP_LOGD("TAG", "Opened Door of outdoor station %i", x.address);
      }
```

### Read Memory Complete
The `on_read_memory_complete` callback of the `tc_bus` hub allows you to work with the memory buffer, accessible as the `x` variable.

```yaml
on_read_memory_complete:
  - logger.log: "Completed memory reading!"
  - lambda: |-
      std::string hexString = str_upper_case(format_hex(x));
      ESP_LOGI("tc_bus", "Memory Dump: %s", hexString.c_str());
```

### Read Memory Timeout
The `on_read_memory_timeout` callback of the `tc_bus` hub allows you to detect a failed memory reading. Most probably when a model doesn't support the related telegrams.

```yaml
on_read_memory_timeout:
  - logger.log: "Failed to read Memory"
```

### Identification of Indoor Station Complete
The `on_identify_complete` callback of the `tc_bus` hub allows you to utilize the [ModelData](#model-data) struct, accessible as the `x` variable.

```yaml
on_identify_complete:
  - logger.log: "Completed identification!"
  - lambda: |-
      std::string hexString = str_upper_case(format_hex(x));
      ESP_LOGI("tc_bus", "Memory Dump: %s", hexString.c_str());
```

### Identification of Indoor Station Complete (Unknown Model)
The `on_identify_unknown` callback of the `tc_bus` hub allows you to detect a unknown model identification of the indoor station. Most probably when a model is too old and doesn't support this process or is not implemented yet.

```yaml
on_identify_unknown:
  - logger.log: "Failed to identify indoor station - unknown model!"
```

### Identification of Indoor Station Timeout
The `on_identify_timeout` callback of the `tc_bus` hub allows you to detect a failed identification of the indoor station. Most probably when a model is too old doesn't support this process.

```yaml
on_identify_timeout:
  - logger.log: "Failed to identify indoor station!"
```


## Actions
### Read Memory
The `tc_bus.read_memory` action allows you to read the memory of any indoor station using the serial number.

```yaml
on_...:
  - tc_bus.read_memory:
      serial_number: 123456
```

### Identify devices on the Bus
The `tc_bus.identify` action allows you to automatically detect the model of a device on the bus using its serial number.

::: tip Note
Automatic identification is not supported by all devices. Currently, only indoor stations are fully supported in the identification process. However, you will still receive a response with the device's identification data, even for unsupported models.
:::

By default, if `device_group` is not specified, the action will attempt to identify a device in group 0 first, then group 1 if no match is found.

```yaml
on_...:
  - tc_bus.identify:
      serial_number: 123456
```

To target a specific type of device, you can explicitly set the `device_group`:

```yaml
on_...:
  - tc_bus.identify:
      serial_number: 123456
      device_group: 3
```

### Set Programming Mode
The `tc_bus.set_programming_mode` action allows you to enable or disable the programming mode of the control unit.

```yaml
on_...:
  - tc_bus.set_programming_mode:
      programming_mode: true
```

### Update Setting
The `tc_bus.update_setting` action allows you to change the supported settings of any indoor station.
Take a look at the [supported models and settings](#model-setting-availability).

```yaml
on_...:
  - tc_bus.update_setting:
      type: volume_ringtone
      value: 7
      serial_number: 123456
```

### Sending Telegrams

You can send telegrams on the bus using the `tc_bus.send` action.

::: tip Note
You can either use the `telegram` field to send a specific telegram or use the `type`, `address`, `payload`, and `serial_number` fields to create a more complex message. **Both cannot be used at the same time**.

You can explicitly send a 32-bit telegram by using the optional `is_long` property, which is useful when the telegram begins with leading zeros.
:::

#### Example 1: Sending a raw Telegram

```yaml
on_...:
  - tc_bus.send:
      telegram: 0x1A2B3C4D
```
#### Example 2: Sending a raw Telegram with fixed size

```yaml
on_...:
  - tc_bus.send:
      telegram: 0x00000280
      is_long: True
```

#### Example 3: Sending a Telegram via Telegram Builder

```yaml
on_...:
  - tc_bus.send:
      type: open_door
      address: 0
      payload: 0
      serial_number: 123456
```

## Event Handling
If the `event` parameter is set (and not `none`), an event is generated each time a telegram is received. You can monitor these events in Home Assistant on the [developer tools](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_events/) page.

Each time a telegram is received, an event like the following is generated:

```yaml
event_type: esphome.doorman
data:
  device_id: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  telegram: "0x00002400"
  type: "end_of_door_readiness"
  address: "0"
  payload: "0"
  serial_number: "0"
origin: LOCAL
time_fired: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000000+00:00"
context:
  id: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  parent_id: null
  user_id: null
```

To trigger a Home Assistant automation based on this event, you can use an `event` trigger:

```yaml
platform: event
event_type: esphome.doorman
event_data:
  telegram: "0x00002480"
```

```yaml
platform: event
event_type: esphome.doorman
event_data:
  type: "end_of_door_readiness"
  address: "0"
  serial_number: "0"
```

Be sure to modify the telegram and event name as needed based on your configuration.

## Advanced Configuration

### Accessing intercom settings
If you need to access the supported settings in the memory buffer you can use the `get_setting` method of the `tc_bus` hub.
Take a look at the [setting types](#setting-types).

Example (read and write setting):
```yaml
button:
  - platform: template
    name: "Read Handset volume"
    on_press:
      -lambda: |-
          ESP_LOGD("TAG", "Handset volume: %i", id(tc_bus_intercom)->get_setting(SETTING_VOLUME_HANDSET_DOOR_CALL));

  - platform: template
    name: "Set Handset volume"
    on_press:
      - tc_bus.update_setting:
          type: volume_handset_door_call
          value: 7
```

## Telegram Data
The `TelegramData` struct is used internally and can also be used in the `on_telegram`.

```c++
struct TelegramData {
    uint32_t raw;
    std::string hex;

    TelegramType type;
    uint8_t address;
    uint32_t serial_number;
    uint32_t payload;
    
    bool is_long;
    bool is_response;
};
```

## Model Data
The `ModelData` struct is used internally in the identification process.

```c++
struct ModelData {
    Model model = MODEL_NONE;
    uint32_t firmware_version = 0;
    uint8_t firmware_major = 0;
    uint8_t firmware_minor = 0;
    uint8_t firmware_patch = 0;
    uint8_t hardware_version = 0; 
    uint8_t category = 0;
    uint8_t memory_size = 0; 
};
```
