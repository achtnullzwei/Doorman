# Release Notes & Changelog
Welcome to the latest updates! Here's a breakdown of all the **new features**, **improvements**, and important **changes** you need to know. Be sure to check out the **Breaking Changes** section for any actions needed to keep everything running smoothly.

## 2025.6.0
### 🚨 IMPORTANT
Please carefully review the breaking changes listed below before updating!  
This release **will impact your current setup** and **requires** you to go through the **setup process again**.

### 🚀 What's New?
- **Expanded Support for Model-Specific Settings**  
   Settings compatibility has been added for TCS TASTA / Koch TC60 (`IVW5xxx`, `ISW5xxx`) and Ecoos (`IVW22xx`) models.

- **Added Support for Acknowledgment Messages**  
   Acknowledgment messages are now properly handled, following additional investigation into previously unsupported cases.

- **Streamlined Door Control with Unified Lock Entities**  
  The `Open Door` buttons have been replaced by new, standardized lock entities.  
  You can now use the `lock.unlock` action in Home Assistant for seamless door control.  
  This change simplifies dashboard integration and delivers a more consistent, intuitive experience.

- **Use Light Entity instead of Button for Hallway Light**  
  The `Turn on the light` button has been replaced by the `Hallway Light` light entity.  
  You can now use the `light.turn_on` action in Home Assistant to turn on the hallway light. This change simplifies dashboard integration and delivers a more consistent, intuitive experience.

- **Extended Ring to Open to Apartment Doorbells**  
   [Ring To Open](https://doorman.azon.ai/guide/features/ring-to-open) now also works with your apartment doorbell when paired with a Nuki Smart Lock — making access even more convenient and seamless.

- **MQTT Integration**  
  The configuration assistant now allows you to select the [MQTT integration](https://doorman.azon.ai/guide/firmware/mqtt).  
  After flashing, just enter your broker credentials via the built-in web interface.

- **HomeKit Integration**  
  To enable native control through Apple's Home app and Siri, you can now choose the [HomeKit integration](https://doorman.azon.ai/guide/firmware/homekit) in the configuration assistant.

- **Pre-Open Commands**  
   In some setups, it’s necessary to send one or more preparatory commands to select the correct door. This feature allows you to define and send a sequence of commands before the `open_door` command is executed.

- **Door Opener Mode**  
   It is now possible to activate the integrated relay instead of sending a BUS command to open the entrance door.  
   This can be configured using the `Door Opener Mode` setting and is especially useful for older analog systems.

- **Show Bus Activity via Status LED**  
   Added a new switch that, when enabled, makes the status LED blink briefly to indicate bus activity. Helpful for debugging and verifying communication with the door system. Disabled by default.

### ✨ Improvements
- **Refined Configuration for Ring to Open**  
   The configuration options have been separated per door, giving you greater flexibility to customize the [Ring To Open](https://doorman.azon.ai/guide/features/ring-to-open) behavior according to your specific requirements.

   Additionally, the Delay settings are now presented as dropdown menus, making it more intuitive to use the random delay feature—which was previously hidden behind the 60-second setting.

- **Smarter Ring to Open with Pattern Recognition**  
  The door now opens only when a configured doorbell ring pattern is detected, offering more precise control over access.

- **Quadruple Doorbell Pattern**  
  A new quadruple-press pattern has been added, with slightly refined timing to improve reliability and avoid overlap with other patterns.

- **Extended Model Detection Support**  
   Detection capabilities now include additional older models like the `TTC-xx` and `TTS-xx`.

- **Enhanced Reliability with Remote Peripheral**  
   Data reading is now based on RMT, providing more reliability compared to the previous interrupt-based method.

   The default firmware now includes a Wi-Fi signal strength sensor, which was previously only available in the developer version.

### 📝 Other Updates
- **Firmware Configuration Assistant**  
   The new assistant makes flashing the firmware easier than ever — not much technical experience required.

- **Command Binary Sensors Disabled by Default**  
   Since event entities offer the most convenient way to work with the doorbell, binary sensors are now disabled by default when adding Doorman to Home Assistant. You can still enable them manually at any time if needed.

- **Enhanced Captive Portal UX**  
   Building upon the ESPHome foundation, Doorman now features a custom-branded captive portal, offering a more consistent UX for Wi-Fi configuration.

- **More Readable Log Messages**  
   Log messages have been refined for improved clarity and readability.

### 🚨 Breaking Changes
- **Transition to RMT Components**  
   The `TC:BUS` component no longer supports the `rx_pin` and `tx_pin` options.  
   Instead, you must now define the `remote_receiver` and `remote_transmitter` components when using your own custom config.

- **Removed Open Door and Light Buttons**  
  The `Turn on the light` and `Open Door` buttons have been removed in favor of more efficient control methods.

- **Renamed Ring to Open Entities**  
  The [Ring To Open](https://doorman.azon.ai/guide/features/ring-to-open) entities are now labeled as `RTO: Door Name – Setting` to reflect the updated configuration structure, improving clarity and consistency.

- **Renamed Intercom Model Entity**  
  The `Intercom Model` setting has been renamed to `Indoor Station Model` for more consistency with the documentation and to better reflect its purpose.

- **Renamed Nuki Lock**  
  The `Nuki Lock` entity has been renamed to `Apartment Door` for better alignment with the naming convention used for other doors.

- **Minimum ESPHome Version Set**  
   The minimum required version has been updated to **2025.5.0**.

## 2025.3.0
### ✨ Improvements
- **Fix Update Process**  
   Firmware updates are now correctly identified and retrieved for each specific firmware variant.

   If you don't want the Status LED to blink while Ring to Open is active, you can now easily turn it off.

- **Automatic Model Detection**  
   The setup mode now attempts to automatically identify the indoor station model. However, this process is not compatible with all models, as some do not support automatic detection.

- **Introduced a button to identify your indoor station model**  
   You can now effortlessly determine the correct model for your settings by simply pressing the "Identify Indoor Station" button, perfect for cases where you're unsure which model you own.

- **Expand Support for Model Settings**  
   Implemented settings compatibility for TCS TASTA (Koch TC60) IVW5xxx and ISW5xxx models.

### ✨ Improvements
